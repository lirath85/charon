/**
 * THE one place a user-visible sentence is allowed to name a backend.
 *
 * Charon shows a provider's name in a dozen places — a thinking bar, an
 * availability warning, a sign-in prompt, a notification, a picker's "inherit"
 * option. Every one of them used to build its own sentence, so a hard-coded
 * "Claude" could slip into any of them and only a human running the app would
 * ever notice. It did, repeatedly: the wizard said "⚠ Claude: not installed"
 * about Cursor, the chat said "Claude is thinking" on a Cursor turn, the
 * sidebar offered to "scan existing Claude sessions" for every backend.
 *
 * The rule that replaces all that:
 *
 *   1. Identity is narrowed ONCE, by `asSessionProvider()` — never by a
 *      `k === 'codex' ? … : …` ternary, which silently routes a new provider
 *      into an old one's branch (§14.102).
 *   2. Words come from HERE. A component asks for a sentence; it never writes
 *      a provider's name itself.
 *
 * `tests/providerLabels.test.ts` enforces both, and lists the few modules that
 * ARE one provider's own mechanism and may therefore say its name.
 *
 * Adding a backend changes nothing in this file: every sentence is built from
 * the registry's `label`. Rewording one changes exactly one line.
